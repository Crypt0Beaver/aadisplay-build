Welcome, weary traveler of the digital plains! You've stumbled upon **AADisplay Build**, the magical forge where APKs are lovingly crafted, all while sipping coffee and marveling at the wonders of CI/CD automation. 🚀

## Why Does This Repo Exist? 🤷‍♂️

Well, imagine you’re browsing GitHub, and you find a repository so cool that it makes you say, “Wow, I need this in APK form right now!” But alas, the original repo doesn’t have an automated build system. What's a humble coder to do? Cry? No. Rage quit coding? Definitely not.

Instead, you come here, where APKs are forged with love, laughter, and a touch of insanity.

## What Does This Repo Do? 🛠️

This repository is set up to:
1. Clone the **AADisplay** repository from its rightful owner (thank you, great and mysterious eparla774 🙏).
2. Build the APK automagically using GitHub Actions.
3. Rename the APK with a shiny new name that includes:
   - The product name.
   - The version number (because we’re fancy like that).
   - The last commit date (because history matters).
4. Give you the APK as a downloadable artifact, ready for action.

## How Does It Work? 🧙‍♂️

- Push the big green button in the **Actions** tab.
- Wait for the bots to do their thing.
- Download the freshly baked APK from the artifacts section.
- Bask in the glory of automation.

## Who’s Responsible for This Madness? 🙋‍♂️

This project is maintained by the one and only **Crypt0Beaver**, your friendly neighborhood coder. If you have questions, jokes, or just want to say hi, feel free to open an issue. I promise to respond unless I’m busy saving the world or debugging something... probably debugging.

## Special Thanks 🌟

A huge shoutout to:
- **eparla774**, the creator of the **AADisplay** project. You’re the real MVP. 🍻
- Coffee, because without it, this repo wouldn’t exist.
- Stack Overflow, for being the lighthouse in the stormy sea of coding confusion.

## Disclaimer 📜

- Use this build system responsibly. If your computer explodes, your cat deletes your code, or your coffee turns cold, I take no responsibility.
- This repo is for fun and learning. Don’t go doing anything shady with the APK files, okay? Be a good citizen of the internet.

## License 📜

MIT License. Because sharing is caring. ❤️

May your builds be fast, your errors be few, and your APKs be glorious. Cheers! 🎉
